### 1. File Security

#### 1.1 Hashing stuffs

>[! ]- What is md5sum?
> - A UNIX\Linux open-source tool to generate checksums of files or any texts output, depends on what you want obviously
> - Not restricted to MD5, it also includes SHA256 (`sha256sum`), SHA1 (`sha1sum`) and few more
> - It's part of `coreutils` package in Linux, mostly preinstalled. If not, then something's wrong with your OS distro or worse, you're using Arch.
> 	- `sudo apt install coreutils` - APT 
> 	- `sudo pacman -Sy coureutils` - Arch Pacman
##### Generating md5 from text
```
echo -n "Hello There" | md5sum
```

> [! ]- `echo` with or  without `-n` ???
> - `-n` in `echo` is used to remove the trailing newline generated by default by `echo` command
> - This looks like nothing, but it will generate a totally different hash value if not removed. So, pls use it
> - Example:
> ```
> daniel@ubuntu:~$ echo "Hello" | md5sum
> 09f7e02f1290be211da707a266f153b3  -
> daniel@ubuntu:~$ echo -n "Hello" | md5sum
> 8b1a9953c4611296a827abf8c47804d7  -
> ```


#### 1.2 Chmod it and mod it

> [! ]- Basic things about chmod:
> chmod = **ch**ange **mod**e
> 
> - Used to change how users can access files/directories by modifying read/write/execute permissions
> - 3 types of users in Linux and its symbols 
> 	- Owner/User (u), 
> 	- Group (g), 
> 	- Others (o); 
> 	- Include all 3 types (a)
> 
> - 3 main permissions (symbols/octal value)
> 	- Read (r / 4)
> 	- Write (w / 2)
> 	- Execute (x / 1)


How chmod works (SYMBOLIC mode):

| Commands | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `chmod u+rwx README.txt` | Add all permission to owner |
| `chmod uo-wx README.txt` | Remove write, execute permission from owner and others |

Also how chmod works (OCTAL mode, kind of easier than symbolic, to me anyway):

| Sample | Owner | Group | Others |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `chmod 777 README.txt` | `7 = 4(r) + 2(w) + 1(x)`  | `7 = 4(r) + 2(w) + 1(x)` | `7 = 4(r) + 2(w) + 1(x)` |
| `chmod 642 README.txt` | `6 = 4(r) + 2(w)` | `4(w)` | `2(r)` |


#### 1.3 Chown for chmod

> [! ]- What the hell is chown?
> - chown = **ch**ange **own**ership
> - Used to assign the ownership of a specified file/folder to a different user
> 
> - Basic syntax:
> `chown [new user] [file]`

| Sample | Desc | 
| --- | --- |
| `chown daniel README.txt` | change `README.txt` owner to `daniel` |
