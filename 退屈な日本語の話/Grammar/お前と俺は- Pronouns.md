### Japanese Pronouns Used to Refer to Yourself

As we mentioned earlier, the way you refer to yourself in Japanese depends on your gender. It can also depend on how honorific you want your speech to be. In the chart below, we’ll be breaking down the pronouns for “I” listed in the previous section. This time, we’ll expand on honorific forms.

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|**Pronoun**|**Gender**|**Polite**|**Honorific**|
|_Watashi_<br><br>私/わたし<br><br>I, me|Neutral, female|_Watakushi_<br><br>私/わたくし|_Ware_<br><br>我|
|_Atashi_<br><br>あたし<br><br>I, me|Female|_Atakushi_<br><br>あたくし|_Atakushi_<br><br>あたくし|
|_Uchi_<br><br>うち<br><br>I, me|Neutral, but more commonly used by females|–|–|
|_Boku_<br><br>僕<br><br>I, me|Male|–|–|
|_Ore_<br><br>俺<br><br>I, me|Male|–|–|
|_Jibun_<br><br>自分<br><br>Myself|Neutral|–|–|
|_Watashitachi_<br><br>私たち<br><br>We, us|Neutral|_Ware ware_<br><br>我々|_Ware ware_<br><br>我々|
|_Bokura_<br><br>僕ら<br><br>We, us|Male|–|–|
|_Orera_<br><br>俺ら<br><br>We, us|Male|–|–|

While _watashitachi_ is the gender-neutral way to say _we_, you can also use gendered pronouns to say _we_ in Japanese. If you identify as male and are speaking for your group, you can use _boku_ or _ore_. Simply attach the suffix _-tachi_（達/たち）to make the pronoun plural.

Another way to pluralize pronouns is by adding the suffix _-ra_ (ら) to the end of the pronoun. However, this should be contained to casual speech. It also isn’t as common to pluralize the pronouns _watashi_ (私) or _atashi_ (あたし) using _-ra_, as it’s more often used by men. For example, a man might say _orera_ (俺ら) or _bokura_ (僕ら) when referring to himself and his friends. He would only do so in a casual situation, and only to people in the same age or social group as himself.

Overall, here are some examples of the pronouns used to refer to oneself:

- If you have any questions about the menu, please ask me.  
    メニューについての質問がございましたら、わたくしにお問い合わせください.  
    __Menyuu ni tsuite no shitsumon ga gozaimashitara, watakushi ni otooi awase kudasai.__
- We entered an all-boys’ high school.  
    俺らは男子高に入った.  
    __Orera wa danshi kou ni haitta.__
- I’m going shopping with my friend today.  
    今日、あたしは友だちと買い物に行く.  
    _Kyou,_ __atashi wa tomodachi to kaimono ni iku.__
- We’re getting married in June. 
    私たちは6月に結婚します.  
    _Watashitachi wa roku gatsu ni kekkon shimasu._

### Japanese Pronouns Used to Refer to Others

The pronouns used to refer to other people don’t depend on the speaker’s gender or the subject’s. It’s more important to consider how polite you want your speech to sound. Below is a chart of the pronouns used to refer to other people, as well as how polite each pronoun is.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Pronoun**|**Meaning**|**Level of Formality**|
|_Anata_<br><br>あなた|You|Polite|
|_Kimi_<br><br>君/きみ|You|Casual|
|_Anta_<br><br>あんた|You|Very casual|
|_Omae_<br><br>お前/おまえ|You|Very casual, can be rude|
|_Anatatachi_<br><br>あなた達/あなたたち|You (plural)|Polite|
|_Kimitachi/Kimira_<br><br>君たち/君ら|You (plural)|Casual|
|_Antatachi/Antara_<br><br>あんた達/あんたら|You (plural)|Very casual|
|_Omaetachi/Omaera_<br><br>お前たち/お前ら|You (plural)|Very casual, can be rude|
|_Kare_<br><br>彼|He, him|Polite|
|_Kanojo_<br><br>彼女|She, her|Polite|
|_Ano kata_<br><br>あの方|That person, they (singular)|Very polite|
|_Ano hito_<br><br>あの人|That person, they (singular)|Casual, can be polite depending on tone|
|_Aitsu_<br><br>あいつ/アイツ|That person, they (singular)|Very casual, can be rude|
|_Karetachi/Karera_<br><br>彼たち/彼ら|They (male)|_Karetachi_ is polite; _karera_ is casual|
|_Kanojotachi/kanojora_<br><br>彼女たち/彼女ら|They (female)|_Kanojotachi_ is polite; _kanojora_ is casual|

As you can see, pronouns for _you_ are particularly numerous, and depend entirely on how politely you want your language to sound. When in doubt, it’s always best to use _anata_ (あなた). You can also use the person’s name, if you know it, accompanied by the suffix –_san_ (～さん). While this isn’t a pronoun, many Japanese people prefer names to pronouns in formal scenarios.

It’s also important to note that, while we’ve listed overly-casual pronouns like _anta_ (あんた), _omae_ (o前), and _aitsu_ (あいつ), you may want to avoid them unless you’re speaking with familiar friends. When used in the wrong tone of voice or in a polite situation, these words can actually be offensive. Some Japanese people even use them as insults when they’re feeling angry.

A proper scenario in which to use overly-casual pronouns would be when you’re out eating or drinking with a close coworker, or perhaps when you’re talking to family members at home.

Let’s practice these pronouns using the example sentences below:

- My name is Frank. What’s your name?  
    私の名前はフランクです. **あなた**の名前は何ですか?  
    _Watashi no namae wa Frank desu._ **_Anata_** __no namae wa nan desu ka?__
- That person was kind enough to lend me fifty yen.  
    **あの方**が親切にも50円を貸してくれました.  
    **_Ano kata_** __ga shinsetu ni mo gojuu en o kashite kuremashita.__
- He wrote a letter to his mother.  
    **彼は**母親に手紙を書きました.  
    **_Kare wa_** __hahaoya ni tegami o kakimashita.__
- That jerk broke my window!**  
    アイツが**ウチの窓を壊しやがった!  
    _Aitsu ga uchi no mado o kowashiyagatta!_

### Japanese Impersonal (Demonstrative) Pronouns

In Japanese, impersonal pronouns—also known as demonstrative pronouns—are more cut and dry than personal pronouns. You don’t need to worry too much about how polite a demonstrative pronoun will make you sound. These pronouns also don’t change depending on your gender. Here’s an exhaustive list of Japanese impersonal pronouns:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Pronoun**|**Meaning**|
|_Kore_<br><br>これ|This, it|
|_Sore_<br><br>それ|That, it|
|_Are_<br><br>あれ|That (referring to something that is distanced from the speaker), it|
|_Koko_<br><br>ここ|Here|
|_Soko_<br><br>そこ|There|
|_Asoko_<br><br>あそこ|Over there|

One of the things learners struggle most with in terms of Japanese demonstrative pronouns, is the difference between _soko_ (そこ) and _asoko_ (あそこ). When you’re considering which of these pronouns to use, think about how far away the noun you’re describing is. This distance can either be physical or metaphorical. For example, if you’re talking about a pair of shoes in the next room, but not right next to you, you would use _sore_. If you were talking about shoes you’d seen in the store a while back, you might say _are_.

Here are some examples to help you remember the different demonstrative pronouns:

- Remember when we used to skip class back in high school? **That** was crazy!  
    高校生の時、授業サボったこと覚えている？**あれ**はやばかった!  
    _Koukousei no toki, juugyou o sabotta koto oboeteiru?_ **_Are_** __wa yabakatta!__
- This is good. Try it!  
    **これ**美味しい. 食べてみて!  
    **_Kore_** __oishii. Tabete mite!__
- Do you see that man over there? He’s my father.  
    **あそこ**の男の人、いるでしょう? あれは私の父です.  
    **_Asoko_** _no otoko no hito, iru deshou? Are wa watashi no chichi desu._

### How to Use Japanese Pronouns

When you’re using pronouns in Japanese, there are several important things to remember. In addition to considering the [proper sentence structure](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/japanese-sentence-structure/), you should also focus on which particles you need for your pronouns and whether you should even include the pronouns in your sentence.

### Don’t Forget Your Particles

In Japanese, particles are vital to marking the role of a word within the sentence. We cover this topic more extensively in our [article on Japanese particles](https://www.clozemaster.com/blog/japanese-particles/), but here’s a list of Japanese particles and what they mark in a sentence:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**_wa_/_ga_**<br><br>**は/が**|marks the **topic/subject** of the sentence|
|**_o_**<br><br>**を**|marks the **object** of the sentence|
|**_ni_**<br><br>**に**|marks the direction of an action|
|**_e_**<br><br>**へ**|marks **destination** and **direction**|
|**_de_**<br><br>**で**|indicates where or how an action takes place|
|**_no_**<br><br>**の**|indicates possession|
|**_mo_**<br><br>**も**|means **“too”** or **“also”**|

A particle will always **follow** the pronoun it marks. Here are some examples of pronouns and their particles being used together:

- This is her favorite song.  
    **これは彼女の**好きな曲です.  
    **_Kore wa kanojo no_** __suki na kyoku desu.__
- I want to go over there.  
    **あそこに**行きたい.  
    **_Asoko ni_** __ikitai.__
- Are you going to eat that?  
    **あれを**食べますか?  
    **_Are o_** _tabemasuka?_

### Think About Whether to Omit Them

Native Japanese speakers often omit subjects and even other parts of the sentence when they speak. This is done for many reasons, with one of the main two being to keep language concise and to avoid confusion with multiple particles.

Most of the words or phrases that are left out of Japanese sentences are those that can be determined by context. Pronouns become a common victim of omission for this reason, as the noun they replace may already have been stated earlier. Here are three common examples of pronoun omission:

1. The speaker omits multiple references to themselves in their speech, as it’s already clear they are talking about their own experience.
2. Possessive pronouns are also often omitted, as listeners will assume that items already belong to the subject in question.
3. The subject or topic of the conversation has already been mentioned once or even several times, so any further references are taken out to make language more concise and fluent-sounding.

Here are some sample sentences for each situation listed above. The omitted words’ English counterparts will be placed in parentheses.

- Today, (I) went to the mall. (I) bought two shirts and met up with (my) girlfriend.  
    今日、ショッピングモールに行った. シャツ２枚を買ったし, 彼女とデートした.  
    __Kyou, shopping mall ni itta. Shirts ni mai katta shi, kanojo to deeto shita.__
- My dad is really interesting. (His) hobby is breakdancing, and (his) favorite color is blue.  
    父は面白い人です. 趣味はブレークダンスで, 好きな色は青色です.  
    __Chichi wa omoshiroi hito desu. Shumi wa breakdance de, suki na iro wa ao iro desu.__
- I saw my best friend for the first time in three years. She hasn’t changed at all. (She) still has a bright smile. (She) still wants to travel to Italy.  
    3年ぶりに親友と会った. 彼女はあまり変わっていない. まだ笑顔はキラキラしたり, 相変わらずイタリアへ両行したい人です.  
    _San nen buri ni shinyuu to atta. Kanojo wa amari kawatteinai. Mada egao wa Kirakira shitari, Italia e ryoukou shitai hito desu._

The very concept of omitting words may be foreign to you, depending on what the rules of your native language are. Still, word omission is a skill that will start to come naturally to you the more you study Japanese.
