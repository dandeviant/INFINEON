The conjunction in Japanese is usually a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_particles) or postposition that’s usually used at the end of the dependent [clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clause)(s), determining the relationship of the conjoined clauses. Examples of these relationships include copulative, disjunctive, adversative, and conclusive.
For example, here are the most common Japanese conjunctions by type:

## 1. What is a Conjunction?
- **Copulative Conjunctions:** The conjunctive relation of units that expresses the addition and/or connection of meanings.
    
    And:  
    と、(_to_)  
    や、 (_ya_)  
    そして (_soshite_)
    
    Also:  
    も、(_mo_)  
    もまた (_mo mata_)
    
    Then:  
    そして、 (_soshite_)  
    それから (_sorekara_)
    
    Or:  
    または、(_mata wa_)  
    また (_mata_)
    

- **Disjunctive Conjunctions:** The conjunctive relation of units that expresses the disjunction of their meanings.
    
    -or, -or : -ka, -ka ‥か、‥か  
    -and, -and : -ya, -ya ‥や、‥や
    

- **Adversative Conjunctions:** The conjunctive relation of units that expresses the opposition of their meanings.
    
    But:  
    しかし、(_shikashi_)  
    が、(_ga_)  
    けど (_kedo_)  
    けれども (_keredomo_)  
    なのに (_nanoni_)  
    でも (_demo_)
    
    However:  
    しかしながら、 (_shikashinagara_)  
    ところが (_tokoroga_)  
    　  
    Despite:  
    にもかかわらず (_nimokakawarazu_)
    

- **Conclusive Conjunctions**
    
    So:  
    それで、(_sorede_)  
    なので (_nanode_)
    
    And then:  
    それから、(_sorekara_)  
    その後 (_sonogo_)
    
    Therefore:　  
    それゆえに、(_soreyue ni_)  
    だから、(_dakara_)  
    したがって (_shitagatte_)
    
    Thus:  
    ゆえに、(_yue ni_)  
    したがって (_shitagatte_)

## 2. Conjunctions to Correlate Similar Thoughts

Here are the commonly used Japanese conjunctions which connect clauses/sentences with a function of addition.

### 1- と (_to_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “and.” It simply adds one thing to another.

- **Usage:**と(_to_) is used when you list everything that’s applicable. と (_to_) can only be used to connect nouns.

- **Example:**
    
    テーブルの上にりんご**と**みかん**と**バナナがあります。  
    _Tēburu no ue ni ringo **to** mikan **to** banana ga arimasu._  
    There are apples, oranges, and bananas on the table.
    
    - In this case, there are only apples, oranges, and bananas on the table.

### 2- や (_ya_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “and.” It adds one thing to another.

- **Usage:** や (_ya_) is similar to と (_to_), but it’s used when you list only some parts of a whole, which are applicable. や (_ya_) can only be used to connect nouns.

- **Example:**
    
    テーブルの上にりんご**や**みかんがあります。  
    _Tēburu no ue ni ringo **ya** mikan ga arimasu._  
    There are apples and oranges on the table.
    
    - The translation in English is the same as that for the example for と (_to_). In this case, however, it implies that there are things besides the apple and orange on the table.

### 3- そして (_soshite_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “and.” It adds things to each other, like the last words. It can also mean “thus” and “and then.”

- **Usage:** そして (_soshite_) is used to add noun(s), or to explain an action that follows.

- **Example:**
    
    テーブルの上にりんごとみかん、**そして**バナナがあります。  
    _Tēburu no ue ni ringo to mikan, **soshite** banana ga arimasu._  
    There are apples, oranges, and bananas on the table.
    
    私はりんごを食べます。**そして**みかんも食べます。  
    _Watashi wa ringo o tabemasu. **Soshite** mikan mo tabemasu._  
    I’ll eat an apple. And then I’ll eat an orange, too.

## 3. Conjunctions to Express Condition
### 1- もし (_moshi_)

- **Meaning:** It means simply “if,” but it can also mean “in case” and “supposing.”

- **Usage:** When using もし (_moshi_), the end of a sentence should be conjugated to the conditional form, such as: たら (-_tara_), なら (-_nara_), ならば (-_naraba_), or すると (-_suruto_).
    
    When the conditional form is emphasized, it’s possible to omit もし (_moshi_) and the sentence still keeps the expression of condition.
    

- **Example:**
    
    **もし**明日雨が降る**なら**、ピクニックは中止です。  
    _**Moshi** ashita ame ga furu **nara**, pikunikku wa chūshi desu._  
    If it rains tomorrow, the picnic will be cancelled.
    

### 2- たら (_tara_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “if,” and it denotes a condition.

- **Usage:** As mentioned above, たら (-_tara_) is used at the end of a clause/sentence, along withもし (_moshi_) at the beginning. It’s usually used to express a relationship of assumption, as well as a specific and one-time consequence.

- Example:
    
    **もし**時間があっ**たら**、映画を見たいです。  
    _**Moshi** jikan ga at**tara**, eiga o mitai desu._  
    If I have time, I want to watch a movie.
    

### 3- なら (_nara_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “if,” and it denotes a condition.

- **Usage:** なら (-_nara_) is also used at the end of a clause/sentence, along withもし (_moshi_) at the beginning.
    
    Unlike たら (-_tara_), なら (-_nara_) is usually used to express a speaker’s decision, order, hope, or opinion of assumption when assuming a certain thing.
    

- **Example:**
    
    京都へ行く**なら**、新幹線で行きたいです。  
    _Kyōto e iku **nara**, Shinkansen de ikitai desu._  
    If I go to Kyoto, I want to go by Shinkansen.
    

### 4- すると (_suruto_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “if,” and it denotes a condition.すると (_suruto_) can also mean “then.”

- **Usage:** When using すると (_suruto_) as a conditional conjunction, と (_to_) or だと (_da to_) usually come in front of it. It expresses a relationship of assumption and a consequence.

- **Example:**
    
    彼が間に合わない**とすると**、私たちは会議を始められません。  
    _Kare ga maniawanai **to suruto**, watashi-tachi wa kaigi o hajimeraremasen._  
    If he can’t come in time, we can’t start a meeting.

## 4. Conjunctions to Express Cause

There’s also a number of Japanese conjunctions which are used to express cause. Combining two clauses/sentences with the following conjunctions denotes a reason and result. In Japanese grammar, note that the clause/sentence that states the reason comes first.

### 1- だから (_da kara_) / から (_kara_)

- **Meaning:** This word can mean “so,” “therefore,” or “thus.”

- **Usage:** だから (_da kara_) and から (_kara_) are very similar. However, a noun usually comes in front of だから (_da kara_), and an adjective or verb comes before から (_kara_).

- **Example:**
    
    明日は日曜日**だから** 仕事はしません。  
    _Ashita wa nichi-yōbi **da kara** shigoto wa shimasen._  
    Tomorrow is Sunday, so I don’t work.
    
    太る**から**ケーキは食べません。  
    _Futoru **kara** kēki wa tabemasen._  
    I will get fat, so I don’t eat cakes.
    

When considering the word order in Japanese grammar, it’s easier to remember the meaning as “so” rather than “because,” to match the order in English grammar.

### 2- ので (_node_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “so” or “thus.”

- **Usage:** ので (_node_) is used the same way as から (_kara_), but ので (_node_) is somewhat more polite.

- **Example:**
    
    辛い**ので**食べられません。  
    _Karai **node** taberaremasen._  
    It is spicy, so I can’t eat it.
    

### 3- ため (_tame_) / のため (_no tame_)

- **Meaning:** This word can mean “because (of) …” or “as a consequence of …”

- **Usage:** Both ため (_tame_) and のため (_no tame_) have the same meaning, but an adjective or verb usually comes before ため (_tame_), and a noun comes in front of のため (_no tame_).

- **Example:**
    
    宝くじが当たった**ため**、私は車を買いました。  
    _Takarakuji ga atatta **tame**, watashi wa kuruma o kaimashita._  
    I bought a car because I won the lottery.
    
    雪**のため**電車は遅れました。  
    _Yuki **no tame** densha wa okuremashita._  
    Because of the snow, the train was delayed.
    

### 4- なぜなら (_nazenara_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “because.”

- **Usage:** When you use なぜなら (_nazenara_), please remember that a sentence of a particular situation comes before なぜなら (_nazenara_), and a sentence to explain why follows it. It often comes with だから (_da kara_) or から (_kara_) to explain why.

- **Example:**
    
    彼女は怒って帰りました。**なぜなら**彼氏が浮気したのを知った**から**です。  
    _Kanojo wa okotte kaerimashita. **Nazenara** kareshi ga uwaki shita no o shitta **kara** desu._  
    She got angry and left, because she came to know her boyfriend had cheated on her.

## 5. Conjunctions to Express Opposition

Here are several examples of Japanese conjunctions which are used to denote contrast.

### 1- しかし (_shikashi_) / でも (_demo_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “but” or “however.”

- **Usage:** Both しかし (_shikashi_) and でも (_demo_) are the most commonly used conjunctions to express opposition. They usually come at the beginning of a sentence and refer to the statement which was mentioned before. しかし (_shikashi_) is often used in formal situations, while でも (_demo_) is more casual and colloquial.

- **Example:**
    
    気温は低く寒いです。**しかし**、 花が咲きました。  
    _Kion wa hikuku samui desu. **Shikashi**, hana ga sakimashita._  
    The temperature is low and it’s cold. However, flowers bloom.

### 2- が (_ga_) / だが (_daga_)

    お金はある**が**、旅行する時間がない。  
    _O-kane wa aru **ga**, ryokō suru jikan ga nai._  
    I have money, but I don’t have time to travel.

### 3- ところが (_tokoroga_) / なのに (_nanoni_)

- **Meaning:** This word means “but” or “however.”

    彼女は勉強をしなかった。**とことろが**、試験に受かった。  
    _Kanojo wa benkyō o shinakatta. **Tokoroga**, shiken ni ukatta._  
    She did not study. But she passed the examination.
    
    彼は先生だ。**なのに**、英語を話せない。  
    _Kare wa sensei da. **Nanoni**, eigo o hanasenai._

### 4- けど (_kedo_) / けれども (_keredomo_)

- **Meaning:** This word can mean “but,” “however,” “though,” and “although.”

- **Usage:** While しかし (_shikashi_) and でも (_demo_) are often used at the beginning of a sentence with a comma, けど (_kedo_) and けれども (_keredomo_) are used to conjoin two separate sentences to express reverse conditions.
    
    けど (_kedo_) and けれどもけど (_keredomo_) are almost the same. However, けれども (_keredomo_) is slightly more formal and polite, while けど (_kedo_) is often used in a casual way and in colloquial speech.

    外は暖かい**けど**、風は冷たい。  
    _Soto wa atatakai **kedo**, kaze wa tsumetai._  
    It is warm outside, but the wind is cold.
