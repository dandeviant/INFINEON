#### Verb Conjugations and Auxiliary Verbs

As mentioned, there are five basic Japanese verb conjugation forms. When verbs conjugate, the verb base (or “stem”) does not change; the stem rather takes on a different suffix or auxiliary verb to convey the proper meaning. 

The correct form is determined by elements such as voice, mood, tense, and politeness level. 

- **Voice**  
      
    There are two types of grammatical voice:  
      
    能動態 (_nōdōtai_) – “active voice”  
    受動態 (_judōtai_) – “passive voice”

- **Mood**  
    Mood is the attitude of the speaker toward the action of the verb. Was the speaker giving an order? Making an assumption? Offering a suggestion?

- **Tense**  
    Tense refers to the time of the verb’s action: past, present, or future.

- **Politeness Level**  
    The Japanese language has honorific speech called [敬語 (_keigo_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese). There are three types of honorific language depending on the level of respect intended:  
      
    丁寧語 (_teinei-go_) – “polite language”  
    尊敬語 (_sonkei-go_) – “respectful language”  
    謙譲語 (_kenjō-go_) – “humble / modest language”

**Example: Tense as an Influential Factor** 

- 食べる (_tabe-ru_) – “eat” [present and plain/informal form]  
    **食べ (****_tabe-_****)** is the verb stem and **る (****_ru_****)** is the suffix.

- 食べた (_tabe-ta_) – “ate” [past and informal form]  
    **食べ (_tabe-_)** is the verb stem and **た (-_ta_)** is an auxiliary verb that expresses the past form.


#### Formal and Informal Forms

As mentioned in the previous section, there are three Japanese honorific speech levels. Native Japanese people, especially in official settings, are expected to have total command over the three different levels so they can use them according to the situation and to whom they’re talking. However, you won’t experience any problems as a foreigner, as long as you can use polite language in daily conversations.

The polite language usually ends with **です(****_-desu_****)** or **ます (****_-masu_****)** in the present/future tense, and **でした (****_-deshita_****)** or **ました (****_-mashita_****)** in the past tense.

The polite language is generally used as a formal form, and casual/plain language is used as an informal form. While the latter is used for talking with family and friends, most people use the former when talking to strangers or staff members at a store or restaurant. 

**Example:**

歩く(あるく) (_aru-ku_) – “to walk” 
- ある (_aru-_) = verb stem
- 歩く (あるく) (_aru-ku_) = informal/plain form
- 歩きます (あるきます) (_aru-kimasu_) = formal/polite form

Each Japanese tense has a formal form (honorific) and an informal form:  
列車が到着**します**、ご注意ください。  
_Ressha ga tōchaku_ **_shimasu_**_, go-chūi kudasai._  
(The train is coming, please be careful.) [formal and polite form]
#### For u-verbs (Class 1 Verbs):

Add either して (_-shite_), いて (-_ite_), って (_-tte_), or  んで (_-nde_) after the verb stem.

- 話す (_hanasu_), “talk” → 話**して** (_hana_**_shite_**)
- 書く (_kaku_), “write” → 書**いて** (_ka_**_ite_**)
- 買う (_kau_), “buy” → 買**って** (_ka_**_tte_**)
- 読む (_yomu_), “read” → 読**んで** (_yo_**_nde_**)

#### For ru-verbs(Class 2 Verbs):

Drop the る (-_ru_) part of the verb and add て (-_te_). 

- 食べ**る** (_tabe_**_ru_**), “eat” → 食べ**て** (_tabe_**_te_**)
- 調べ**る** (_shirabe_**_ru_**), “investigate” → 調べ**て** (_shirabe_**_te_**)
