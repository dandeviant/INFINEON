These two readings are what we know as on'yomi and kun'yomi readings.

- **Onyomi 音読み (おんよみ):** Readings derived from the Chinese pronunciations.
- **Kunyomi 訓読み (くんよみ):** The original, indigenous Japanese readings.

### **ON'YOMI COMPOUNDS**

A two-kanji (or more) compound usually takes the on'yomi readings. These are called _jukugo_ 熟語じゅくご. There are no hanging-on hiragana (okurigana) sticking out from the word.

Also, these words most resemble the Chinese language, which is just one character after another. When you see a compound word like this, chances are these kanji will use the on'yomi readings.

|Japanese|Reading|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|東京|とうきょう|Tokyo|
|先生|せんせい|Teacher|
|元気|げんき|Energy|
|最高|さいこう|Best|
|地下鉄|ちかてつ|Subway|

### **SINGLE KANJI KUN'YOMI**
Most words that consist of a single kanji, sitting all alone with no okurigana, are read with the kun'yomi reading. These include nouns and they make up the majority of beginner words you learn from textbooks and in classrooms.

|Japanese|Reading|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|人|ひと|Person|
|手|て|Hand|
|心|こころ|Heart|
|南|みなみ|South|
|冬|ふゆ|Winter|
### **SINGLE KANJI ON'YOMI**

While less common than single kanji words that use the kun'yomi reading, there are many instances of single kanji using the on'yomi reading. This is especially true for single kanji numbers, but there are plenty of other examples as well.

|Japanese|Reading|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|本|ほん|Book|
|天|てん|Heaven|
|字|じ|Character|
|文|ぶん|Sentence|
|一|いち|One|

### **KUN'YOMI WITH OKURIGANA**
If a kanji has hiragana attached to it, it almost always uses the kun'yomi reading. These kana suffixes are called 
okurigana送り仮名
（
おく　がな
）
 and they are mostly adjectives and verbs, but they can be used for nouns too.
 
|Japanese|Reading|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|大きい|おおきい|Big|
|食べる|たべる|To Eat|
|行く|いく|To Go|
|玉ねぎ|たまねぎ|Onion|
|乗り場|のりば|Bus Stop|
### **KUN'YOMI COMPOUNDS**

Some kanji compounds words, especially those that have to do with nature (very Japanese) or cardinal directions, can take the kun'yomi readings for both kanji. While not as common as on'yomi compounds, they do exist in some very common words.
